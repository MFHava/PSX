Introduction
============
The Parallel STL Extensions (PSX) is a header-only library providing "standard library"-style utilities for effective parallel computations. It fills some holes that are present in the current algorithmic design of the parallel STL extensions.

Requirements
============ 
The PSX requires a conformant C++17 implementation.
The included unit tests depend on CMake and Boost.Test.
